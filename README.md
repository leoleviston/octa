One to eight is a fundamental sequence (see figure 1). Visually speaking, eight is the highest order number.
Zero is more so an imaginary number. Zero is only theoretical, it doesnâ€™t really make sense for continuity and the human experience of time.
Nine is the same as six, only vertically reflected. Ten is a combination of two numbers, one and zero, already defined.
